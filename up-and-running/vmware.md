## Summary

To get npm On-Site up and running in VMWare, you first need:

0. An [npm user account]
1. An npm On-Site license. Get a [free trial] here!
2. [VMWare]

...then we'll need to:

3. Set up and deploy an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Debian, or CentOS VM
4. Run the npmO deploy script
5. Forward ports for the admin panel, registry, and website
