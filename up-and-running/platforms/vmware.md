# Using VMWare

## Summary

To get npm On-Site up and running in VMWare, you first need:

- An [npm user account]
- An npm On-Site license. Get a [free trial] here!
- [VMWare]

...then we'll need to:

1. Create a custom Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Debian, or CentOS VM
2. Run the npmO deploy script
3. Forward ports for the admin panel, registry, and website

Let's get started!
